        The Association of Cyber Engineers (ACE) is an exciting organization here at Louisiana Tech, ready to represent the Cyber Engineering program! ACE is the first organization of its kind, helping students not only learn about the fundamentals of cyber security, but also providing a platform and professional connections for members to use to excel their college career.

        We believe that you learn best in a hands-on environment, so instead of having someone lecture at meetings and tell you about a topic, we give you the tools and actually do it. We discuss and demonstrate all kinds of cyber related topics including: Steganography, Python Scripting, Hacking, and Forensics. In addition to learning about cool new topics that you would not otherwise learn in class, ACE members get to make connections with other students who share similar interests and also professionals in the Cyber Engineering field.

    <p>
        The Association of Cyber Engineers welcomes all students from Engineers to Business to Education Majors. We strive to help everyone understand more about Cyber Engineering and how everyone has a role in cyber security.
